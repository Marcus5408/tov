A quick demo thing whipped up in Godot for Hack Club's Jumpstart Daydream workshop.
This is a simple platformer game where you control a robot using your keyboard. However, the robot can only look in one direction at a time, controlled by the terminal.

## Commands

`sense` - Make the robot look in a direction. Valid directions are `north`, `north-east`, `east`, `south-east`, `south`, `south-west`, `west`, and `north-west`.

`neofetch` - Show system information. Just for fun.

`help` - Show a help message detailing available commands.
